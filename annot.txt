HELP FOR CUSTOM WORD ANNOTATION FEATURE OF WAKAN 1.70+
======================================================

0. Overview

Wakan 1.70 introduces a new feature - the ability to read special "annotation"
files that can make Wakan display a webpage, picture or play a sound whenever
you display a specific word inside the Dictionary or select a specific character
in Character mode. For example, when typing word "bara" (a rose in Japanese) to
the Dictionary, Wakan can display a picture of a rose.

1. .ANO files

The annotation files are normal text files which you can create in any text
editor. They can be either plain-text (8-bit) or Unicode UCS2 (16-bit), but
I strongly recommend that you create them in Unicode UCS2 encoding. The files
must have the extension ".ANO" and must be stored in Wakan folder.

The .ANO file can contain any number of "annotation commands" - one command on
each line. The format of the annotation command is as follows:

<tag>:<annotation>

Where <tag> is specifying for what word of character the annotation should be
displayed and <annotation> is giving details about the annotation.
