This folder contains source files for various tests in JaletTests.

Note that Wakan text files (wtt) are currently dictionary-version-dependent and therefore not portable.
When testing .wtt, do not access translations which will probably be garbage; just test that article numbers are loaded/saved properly.

Where encoding needs to be chosen, UTF16LE should be used.
