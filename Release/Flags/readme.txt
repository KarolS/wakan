Contains language icons for Wakan interface.
Originally these are country icons, so sometimes the language is not matched or the match is wrong. If you notice this, file an issue and I'll correct that.

Or, you may sort this out by yourself, give all languages proper ISO 639-1 names and mail me the result and there will be no end to my gratitude. (I'm joking. There will be an end.)
