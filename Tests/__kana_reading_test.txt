Wakan can be configured to auto-annotate katakana with hiragana, and to display annotations in romaji instead of kana. These two options combine to form the following chart:
1. Auto-annotate disabled.
2. Auto-annotate + normal kana = annotate katakana only.
3. Auto-annotate + romaji = annotate all kana with romaji.

This is the test for auto-annotation feature. In normal kana mode the following should only display annotations for kanji and katakana.
In romaji mode it should display annotations for every syllable, and annotations for combinations such as "った" and "っちゃ" should start over the actual character (skipping sokuon).

そうぞうソウゾウ
おもった
おもっちゃ
思った
思っちゃ

In romaji mode kana annotations for "su suru" should be shifted to the right to accomodate for long annotation for "kutsugae", not replace it.
