Wakan is a versatile tool for students of Japanese or Chinese. It features a character dictionary, a word dictionary, a text editor, a vocabulary management utility, many printing options (character flashcards, vocabulary lists, text including furigana), and a text translation tool. Wakan will help you to read real Japanese or Chinese text with minimum knowledge of characters and vocabulary.

This is the continuation of the [older Wakan project](http://wakan.manga.cz). Many bugs were fixed, user experience improved and features added - see **[Changes](Changes.md)**.

Developer builds can be installed over older Wakans although it's not recommended to use both versions side by side.
