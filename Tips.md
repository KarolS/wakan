# Building vocabulary

The most effective way in my opinion is trying to read an authentic Japanese or Chinese text. When you encounter some words you do not know, try to locate them in the [dictionary](Dictionary.md). If it is a word you would like to know, you can immediately [add it to vocabulary](Dictionary#Add_word_to_vocabulary.md). Assign all the words from one source to one [category](Vocabulary#Categories.md). When you finish reading the text, you can then print all the unknown words from the text by printing [vocabulary](Vocabulary.md) words from the category you added them to. You can use the printed list as a help for building clues to remember the words or simply as a reference when you will read the text again. Do not try to learn large lists of vocabulary. It is the most ineffective and most boring method. Instead look at some words on the list you would like to learn, try to build some entertaining clues (like building a story from the characters they consist of) and then go on reading some other text or doing something else. When you encounter the words again, the program will hint you that you have already added them to vocabulary and from the category they are assigned to you will know where you have encountered them first.

If you would like to check whether you have remembered some of the words you added to vocabulary before, you can use the **learning list** option in [vocabulary window](Vocabulary.md) to randomly select words for checking. You can set words you knew well as "mastered" to prevent selecting them again.

If you are working with a Japanese text, you can use the [text translator tool](Editor.md) to add furigana to unknown characters and fill meaning for words you don't know (which are not in your vocabulary). You can print the text including furigana and word meanings. If you are learning katakana, you can print the text with hiragana transcript above katakana.

# Learning characters

You can add interesting characters to the [clipboard](MainWindow#Clipboard_viewer.md) and
then [print character cards](KanjiList#Character_cards.md). For learning reading of characters, it is very effective to look at the [compounds](KanjiList#Compounds.md) in your vocabulary. Maybe you already know some word that contains the character and that can hint you on the reading.

If you would like to learn some new characters but don't know which, you can either select suitable characters by frequency or by Jouyou grade (for Japanese) or you can use the **Recommend kanji** option in [vocabulary window](Vocabulary.md).
