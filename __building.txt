NOTES ON BUILDING WAKAN.

I. For Ansi builds you'll need non-unicode Delphi (at most Delphi 2007).
Install everything as per Components\readme.txt.

II. Copy wakan.chr, *.dic from live wakan installation.

III. Build Jalet.dpr.

If you want to pack executable, you'll need something like UPX.exe which is not included here.

IV. Run Wakan to generate:
  wakan.usr -- empty user package
  wakan.sod -- stroke order package built from strokes.csv (included)
  wakan.rad -- raine radical search package built from RADKFILE/RADKFILE2 (see dependencies)

V. Pack these files into a distribution:
  jalet.exe -> wakan.exe
  wakan.cfg
  wakan.sod
  wakan.rad
  wakan.chr
  any dictionaries
  lng\*.*
  possibly: UNICONV.exe + related files
  possibly: wordfreq_ck for frequency generation


OPTIMIZATION

1. Enable inlining (inline:on or inline:auto).
It's very important that some critical functions are inlined for speed in release builds.
Therefore if you're doing the building, READ THIS:
http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/XE/en/Calling_Procedures_and_Functions#Using_the_inline_Directive
Note the list of cases when the inlining is not done.

2. Disable "Compiling> String format checking" in Delphi Project Options:
http://www.micro-isv.asia/2008/10/needless-string-checks-with-ensureunicodestring/
They shouldn't be needed, and even if by some mistake we put Ansi chars into UnicodeString, we better crash and fix that instead of hiding the bug.
Enabling this option also effectively disables the "const s:string" optimizations since functions will get refcount management frames for strings anyway.
