# Since Wakan 1.67 to Wakan 1.85

**Warning**: Dictionary format changed. Wakan 1.80+ can load older dictionaries, but new dictionaries will not load in older Wakans.

  * Auto-import and auto-update for dictionaries. Just place the latest EDICT/EDICT2/CEDICT/etc file in the Wakan folder.

  * You can now abort the translation process at any time.
  * Aozora-Ruby support. Load or paste text with aozora-ruby and it'll be displayed with ruby above the text. Save auto-generated readings in Aozora-Ruby format and read the text in your favorite aozora-bunko reader.
  * Export as HTML with Ruby (Issue 24 (on Google Code)), OpenDocument Text with Ruby (opens in LibreOffice) (Issue 113 (on Google Code)), kanji+kana with spaces (Issue 58 (on Google Code))  **1.8.16**
