Wakan lets you quickly download or update dictionaries and other application components. This is done from `Database > Download / update components...`

> ![images/downloader-select.png](images/downloader-select.png)

You can select any number of components to be downloaded simultaneously.

A flag indicates the component target language (not Japanese/Chinese but the language in which the kanji/words are described).

Items in bold are already present on this computer and may only need to be updated.

Dictionaries will automatically be imported after downloading. With Kanji dictionaries you'll need to manually import those at this time (`Database> Settings> Database maintenance> Import character data`)
