Where Wakan stores it's configuration and data.

1. Whether Wakan works in portable mode or not.

2. Where Wakan stores settings (registry / wakan.ini).

3. Where Wakan stores common and user data (local folder / AppData).

4. Any auto-upgrade procedures and settings related to this.

Ideally, this should provide a transparent way to access settings and user data to the other modules.
